> Necessary
* Include selected key labels in stored keyboard data
* User-editable wheel sensitivity => app settings menu?
* Convert getX methods to getters
Temperaments!
  * Move Temperaments UI to control bar - how to integrate with tracks?
  * Group otonal and utonal variants
  * Colour coding on temperaments?
  * Order chords by adicity vs symmetry
  * Gesture drag through chord inversions? Allow selection of pivot position other than the root
    => Setting a key for the keyboard and transposing note names through the key
  * Generate commas and chords off the main thread; UI for moving a computation to a jobs list (Important!), pausing/resuming etc (may require a different approach/algorithm)
BigInt Interval (Important!)
Save & delete keyboard layouts
Render pipeline (hex grid then labels), redraw by hex whitelist (use neighbours)
Track class
MenuState class

> Would be nice
Grid vertical origin dragger
Sticky buttons? Pedal?
Moment-of-symmetry scales (related to orientations); compute all orientations on edo change?
Relabelling keys while playing: relative to lowest note, relative to chosen key

BUG sound clicking on mobile
BUG if the viewport is resized too small, the hex grid disappears and the control bar freaks out
BUG keep track of 2s..., eg to identify intervals that function as lower than 1/1 or over 2/1
BUG separate black/white key colours for ghost keys?

What would "Mary had a little lamb" sound like expressed as beats subdividing a repeating duration? Eg. 12 equal polyrhythms which stack to a halving/doubling of time
