Make work in Chrome and Safari
* Include selected key labels in stored keyboard data
* User-editable wheel sensitivity => app settings menu?
* Limit notes to frequencies between 10 and 40000 Hz; shade echo notes according to octave difference
* Refactor keyboard data lifecycle
* let -> const in main.js
* Persist keys ln, ld => decomp + BigInt n, d
Temperaments!
  * Copyable Key (changes key of keyboard)
  * Group otonal and utonal variants; How to classify chords of the same temperament?
  * Colour coding on temperaments?
  * Order chords by adicity vs symmetry vs simplest internal interval
  * Gesture drag through chord inversions? Allow selection of pivot position other than the root
    => Setting a key for the keyboard and transposing note names through the key
  * Generate chords off the main thread; UI for moving a computation to a jobs list (Important!)
    => Provide real time logs during computation to display in job area
    => Group chords by adicity/stack and return partial results
    => Pausing/resuming etc (may require a different approach/algorithm)
  * Splitting commas
BigInt Interval (Important!)
Render pipeline (hex grid then labels), redraw by hex whitelist (black hex to clear then source-over with neighbours)
Track class
MenuState class
Scales
  * Moment-of-symmetry (related to orientations); compute all orientations on edo change?
  * Compute motion between chords; Threshhold to include a scale?

> Would be nice
Grid vertical origin dragger
Sticky buttons? Pedal?
Relabelling keys while playing: relative to lowest note, relative to chosen key

> Outside scope
Giving musical objects ungeneralisable proper names or symbols

> Bugs
* Enumerate chords based on tempered intervals
* What triggers the 2/1 bug?
* Keep track of 2s..., eg to identify intervals that function as lower than 1/1 or over 2/1
* Separate black/white key colours for ghost keys?

> Documentation
* Explain chord names in relation to inversions, eg IV 6/4 becomes IV 3:4:5, II 2 becomes II 7:8:10:12, etc

> Misc
What would "Mary had a little lamb" sound like expressed as beats subdividing a repeating duration? Eg. 12 equal polyrhythms which stack to a halving/doubling of time
